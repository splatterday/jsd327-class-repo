# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|May 1st| Project Description | Bingo
|May 8th| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|May 15th| External API(s) Decision / Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|May 22nd| Minimal Viable Product | Incomplete
|May 29th| Styling / Bug Fixes | Incomplete


## Project Description

The project is a Quit Smoking app which has two functional sides.
One side tracks the date of your last smoke, then presents that data based on time since/time until certain milestones (12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours etc.)

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Save Quit Date/Time
- Render visual progress through first 4 days
- Render visual progress 4+ days
- Show quit progress when milestones are pressed.
- Breathing game

#### PostMVP 

- Improve graphics

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous  phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Log Quit Date | H | 3hrs| Xhrs | Xhrs |
| First 4 Days Visualizer | H | 20hrs| XXhrs | XXhrs |
| 4+ Days Visualizer | H | 15hrs| XXhrs | XXhrs |
| Breathing Game | H | 20hrs| 2hrs | XXhrs |
| Total | H | 58hrs| 2hrs | XXhrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## jQuery Discoveries
